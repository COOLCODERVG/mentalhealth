⚠️ This is a collaborative project. Here are my personal contributions to the MentalHealth Tracker app:

-🔧 Frontend Features & Styling
I contributed to building and styling several frontend components, including the mood tracking UI and parts of the journaling system using React and Tailwind CSS.

-📊 Data Visualization
I helped implement and customize the Insights page using Chart.js to show mood trends over time.

-🛠️ Bug Fixes & Polish
I helped debug UI inconsistencies across mobile and desktop views, and made visual polish tweaks for a cleaner experience.

-🧪 Testing & Feedback
I assisted with testing key features like mood submission, journal saving, and login flow, and provided user feedback to improve the UX.

-📄 Project Documentation
I contributed to updating the README to reflect the latest setup instructions and project structure.
